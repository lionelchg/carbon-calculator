# Carbon Calculator

A comprehensive carbon emissions application that allows you to synthesize all figures related to carbon emissions from artificial intelligence, global energy systems, and personal activities.

## Features

### üñ•Ô∏è AI & GPU Emissions Page
Interactive charts and visualizations showing:
- Global datacenter power growth (49 GW to 96 GW by 2026)
- Energy breakdown (servers 60%, cooling 20%, networking 5%, other 15%)
- AI energy consumption projections (415 TWh to 945 TWh by 2030)
- GPU specifications and efficiency metrics (NVIDIA H100 DGX servers)
- Environmental impact projections (4.5% of global energy by 2030)

### üåç Global Emissions Page
Comprehensive infographics with real-world data including:
- Global energy mix visualization (30% renewable, 35.4% coal, 22.5% gas)
- Renewable growth trends (solar +23%, wind +9.8% in 2023)
- Regional CO‚ÇÇ emissions breakdown by country
- Carbon intensity improvements (record low at 480 gCO‚ÇÇ/kWh)
- Key climate insights and transition statistics

### üßÆ Personal Calculator
Interactive carbon footprint calculator featuring:
- **Transportation tracking**: Calculate emissions from car trips (200km), plane flights (1000km), and train travel
- **Diet impact calculation**: Track weekly consumption of beef, pork, chicken, fish, or vegetarian meals
- **Real-time totals**: See your carbon footprint update as you add activities
- **Environmental context**: Understand your impact with tree planting equivalents and coal burning comparisons
- **Reference data**: Built-in carbon factors for accurate calculations

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Visualizations**: Recharts for interactive charts and graphs
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Styling**: CSS with responsive grid layouts
